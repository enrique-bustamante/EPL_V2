## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to develop a more efficient way of
obtaining the player data and conducting a prediction model to make better
decisions for determining players.


### Webscraping

Utilizing the api, the player data and statistics were pulled for preparation
of the data to pass through the machine learning model.

### Differences in This Version

The first major difference is that the data is no longer updated on tables
manually. Webscraping is now utilized to pull the data. Next, instead of
linear regression, Random Forests are utilized in the prediction model.
Lastly, the tables are now being displayed on their very own page, rather than
all four on one page.
